# Sign_Language_Classifier-using-CNN
In this repository the classify various sign languages(26 signs images) using Convolution Neural Network.


The model classififies the sign images and give is the correct result what that image means.
Also input values are pixel values but not images.
the model converts the pixel values into images.

The CNN model consists of images that are image augumented from various angles to avoid overfitting.
